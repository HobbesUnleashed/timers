# Rack 'n' Beard Shot timer

Rack 'n' Beard shot timers is an online website that provides a selection of countdown timers for users to choose between, depending upon their requirements for the game or tournament that they are participating in.

These timers are developed with the express intention of being used within the game of 8-ball pool and has been designed to reflect this sport in the images and terminology used. Within this sport there are certain actions that can be invoked by the player/user, such as calling for an extension to their time to allow for further planning for their turn - however restrictions also apply to how and when these can be used.

## User Experience (UX)

This website was developed to allow 8-ball pool enthusiasts wishing to add a time restriction to their game. Other timers are available but limit the user to a single, pre-determined time for each visit to the table.

This site has the added benefit of allowing the user to choose between a selection of four individual timers ranging from 15 to 60 seconds, incrementing by 15 seconds.

There is also the added option of changing the presentation of the site from a black and white styling to an all colour option allowing for a little more personalisation for the user in how they view the site.
